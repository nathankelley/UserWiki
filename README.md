Updating swagger docs:

To update your respective swagger doc, go to the "swagger-docs" folder. There, you will see 3 docs: 

- users_swagger.json
- pokemon_swagger.json
- eldenring_swagger.json

Each one is made so that we can go into it and update it should we need to. I would recommend that we each take the following doc:

Will - pokemon_swagger.json
Jose - users_swagger.json
Nathan - eldenring_swagger.json

The swagger.json and swagger.js files that used to exist in the project have been removed and the swagger.js file handles the routes to the corresponding 
api-docs with the following endpoints:

/api-docs/users
/api-docs/pokemon
/api-docs/eldenring
